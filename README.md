# robot-nerf

This project is a Nerf gun attached to a partially built SCARA robot arm.  Using pose tracking, the gun will aim and open fire if you don't put your hands up!

**Overview**

The robot arm is built from a combination of steel-tube and 3D printed parts, with motion provided by stepper motors.  Control comes in the form of an Arduino Uno with CNC shield.  The X-axis is configured on the arm to rotate about the main axis, and the Nerf gun is attached to this axis. This means the X-axis of the arm directly controls the angle of the gun.
